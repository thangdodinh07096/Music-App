# SampleMusicPlayer
Simple music player
## Intro
This project was due to a stack overflow request.

Then I decided, why make a simple audio player that can actually do stuff?

Since then, I have kept enjoying adding more features and fixing bugs thanks to all you guys.

Some code is a derivative of my other complex Music player project:
